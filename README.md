# **Brain Tumor MRI**
This project focuses on the development of a deep learning model for the detection of brain tumors from MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans. The objective is to accurately classify whether a patient has a brain tumor or not based on their MRI images.

Project Overview
- Data Collection(kaggle): Acquisition of a dataset containing labeled MRI scans of patients with and without brain tumors. The dataset is essential for training and evaluating the deep learning model.
- Data Preprocessing: Extensive preprocessing of the MRI images to enhance quality, remove noise, and ensure uniformity across the dataset. Preprocessing techniques may include normalization, resizing, and augmentation.
- Model Development: Construction of a deep learning model using Keras and TensorFlow, specifically tailored for medical image analysis. The model architecture typically involves convolutional neural networks (CNNs) due to their effectiveness in learning spatial features from images.
- Training and Evaluation: Training the model on the preprocessed MRI dataset and evaluating its performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Cross-validation techniques may be employed to ensure the robustness of the model.
